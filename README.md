clickhouse_sinker is a sinker program that transfer kafka message into [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.yandex/).

## Features

* Easy to use and deploy, you don't need write any hard code, just care about the configuration file
* Custom parser support.
* Support multiple sinker tasks, each runs on parallel.
* Support multiply kafka and ClickHouse clusters.
* Bulk insert (by config `bufferSize` and `flushInterval`).
* Parse messages concurrently (by config `concurrentParsers`).
* Loop write (when some node crashes, it will retry write the data to the other healthy node)
* Uses Native ClickHouse client-server TCP protocol, with higher performance than HTTP.

## Configuration

See config [example](./conf/config.json)

## Custom metric parser

* You just need to implement the parser interface on your own

```
type Parser interface {

}
```
See [json parser](./parser/json.go)
